This repository has been created with the main objective of contribute to the open source data project from Idealista https://github.com/paezha/idealista18
Concretely, the purpose of this project is to be able to download the .rda files with a Python script, and be able to work with them by algorithms developed in Python by reading those files as dataframes that can be easily handled with libraries such as pandas.
